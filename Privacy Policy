Effective: 2 October 2025
Contact: darencorvair@gmail.com

Halo Controller (“we”, “us”) provides the ability to change the settings in the Halo Strobe Controller. This policy explains what data we collect (NONE), why we collect it (WE DON'T), how we use it (WE DON'T), and the choices you have.

## 1. Data we collect
We do **not** collect: Anything. No data, no nothing. The app is totally stand alone, and does not connect, nor can it connect to any collection device or link.

## 2. How we would use data (if we did collect any, which we don't)
- Provide core features and services
- Comply with law and enforce terms

## 3. Sharing
We do not sell personal data. Mainly because we don't collect or hold any.

## 4. Third-party SDKs
Our app doesn't include any of the following:
- **[Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics/Remote Config]**
- **[AdMob/Ads SDKs]**
- **[Sign-in providers]**


## 5. Data retention
We do not collect nor do we keep data.

## 6. Your choices & rights
- **Permissions**: You can deny or revoke app permissions in system settings.

## 7. Children
It is not intended for children under 13 as they will not be allowed to fly gliders under that age, and so would have no use for it.

## 8. Security
If we did collect data, then we would use technical and organisational measures to protect data. No method is 100% secure, but as we don't hold or collect any data, this truly is secure.

## 9. International transfers
If data was collected and transferred across borders, we would use appropriate safeguards. But as we don't collect any data, we don't have to.

## 10. Changes
We’ll update this policy when practices change. We’ll post the new version here and update the “Effective” date. If changes are material, we’ll notify you in-app or by email.
